This repository showcases various algorithm implementations from our lab exercises. Each lab focuses on a distinct algorithmic concept, exploring approaches like recursion, iteration, divide and conquer, and greedy strategies. Below is a brief overview of each lab:

LAB-1: Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion üå≤
Topic:
Implement and compare the performance of iterative and recursive Binary Search Tree insertion techniques.

Description: This lab involves the implementation of both iterative and recursive methods for inserting elements into a Binary Search Tree (BST). The lab also compares the performance and efficiency of these two approaches.
LAB-2: Merge Sort vs Quick Sort ‚öñÔ∏è
Topic:
Implement Merge Sort and Quick Sort using the divide-and-conquer strategy, and compare their performance on the same dataset.

Description: In this lab, we implement and analyze the performance of two widely-used sorting algorithms, Merge Sort and Quick Sort, when applied to an identical set of elements.
LAB-3: Matrix Multiplication Techniques üßÆ
Topic:
Compare Strassen's Matrix Multiplication with the traditional method.

Description: This lab delves into matrix multiplication, comparing Strassen's algorithm with the conventional matrix multiplication method, evaluating their efficiency across various matrix sizes.
LAB-4: Activity Selection Problem üèÖ
Topic:
Implement the Activity Selection Problem to understand the greedy algorithm approach.

Description: This lab presents the Activity Selection Problem, demonstrating how a greedy algorithm can be used to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
